abstract = {Beneficial modulation of the gut microbiome has high-impact implications not only in humans, but also in livestock that sustain our current societal needs. In this context, we have tailored an acetylated galactoglucomannan (AcGGM) fibre to match unique enzymatic capabilities of Roseburia and Faecalibacterium species, both renowned butyrate-producing gut commensals. Here, we test the accuracy of AcGGM within the complex endogenous gut microbiome of pigs, wherein we resolve 355 metagenome-assembled genomes together with quantitative metaproteomes. In AcGGM-fed pigs, both target populations differentially express AcGGM-specific polysaccharide utilization loci, including novel, mannan-specific esterases that are critical to its deconstruction. However, AcGGM-inclusion also manifests a “butterfly effect”, whereby numerous metabolic changes and interdependent cross-feeding pathways occur in neighboring non-mannanolytic populations that produce short-chain fatty acids. Our findings show how intricate structural features and acetylation patterns of dietary fibre can be customized to specific bacterial populations, with potential to create greater modulatory effects at large.},

abstract = {The secretion of extracellular vesicles, EVs, is a common process in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells for intercellular communication, survival, and pathogenesis. Previous studies have illustrated the presence of EVs in supernatants from pure cultures of bacteria, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative glycan-degrading gut commensals. However, the isolation and characterization of EVs secreted by a complex microbial community have not been clearly reported. In a recent paper, we showed that wood-derived, complex $\beta$-mannan, which shares a structural similarity with conventional dietary fibers, can be used to modulate the porcine gut microbiota composition and activity. In this paper, we investigated the production, size, composition, and proteome of EVs secreted by pig fecal microbiota after 24 h enrichment on complex $\beta$-mannan. Using transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis, we identified EVs with an average size of 165 nm. We utilized mass spectrometry-based metaproteomic profiling of EV proteins against a database of 355 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the porcine colon and thereby identified 303 proteins. For EVs isolated from the culture grown on $\beta$-mannan, most proteins mapped to two MAGs, MAG53 and MAG272, belonging to the orders Clostridiales and Bacilli, respectively. Furthermore, the MAG with the third-most-detected protein was MAG 343, belonging to the order Enterobacteriales. The most abundant proteins detected in the $\beta$-mannan EVs proteome were involved in translation, energy production, amino acid, and carbohydrate transport, as well as metabolism. Overall, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates the successful isolation of EVs released from a complex microbial community; furthermore, the protein content of the EVs reflects the response of specific microbes to the available carbohydrate source.},

abstract = {Liming acidic soils is often found to reduce their N2O emission due to lowered N2O/(N2O + N2) product ratio of denitrification. Some field experiments have shown the opposite effect, however, and the reason for this could be that liming stimulates nitrification-driven N2O production by enhancing nitrification rates, and by favoring ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) over ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA). AOB produce more N2O than AOA, and high nitrification rates induce transient/local hypoxia, thereby stimulating heterotrophic denitrification. To study these phenomena, we investigated nitrification and denitrification kinetics and the abundance of AOB and AOA in soils sampled from a field experiment 2–3 years after liming. The field trial compared traditional liming (carbonates) with powdered siliceous rocks. As expected, the N2O/(N2O + N2) product ratio of heterotrophic denitrification declined with increasing pH, and the potential nitrification rate and its N2O yield (YN2O: N2O-N/NO3–-N), as measured in fully oxic soil slurries, increased with pH, and both correlated strongly with the AOB/AOA gene abundance ratio. Soil microcosm experiments were monitored for nitrification, its O2-consumption and N2O emissions, as induced by ammonium fertilization. Here we observed a conspicuous dependency on water filled pore space (WFPS): at 60 and 70% WFPS, YN2O was 0.03-0.06% and 0.06–0.15%, respectively, increasing with increasing pH, as in the aerobic soil slurries. At 85% WFPS, however, YN2O was more than two orders of magnitude higher, and decreased with increasing pH. A plausible interpretation is that O2 consumption by fertilizer-induced nitrification cause hypoxia in wet soils, hence induce heterotrophic nitrification, whose YN2O decline with increasing pH. We conclude that while low emissions from nitrification in well-drained soils may be enhanced by liming, the spikes of high N2O emission induced by ammonium fertilization at high soil moisture may be reduced by liming, because the heterotrophic N2O reduction is enhanced by high pH.},

abstract = {Background: Commercial biogas upgrading facilities are expensive and consume energy. Biological biogas upgrading may serve as a low-cost approach because it can be easily integrated with existing facilities at biogas plants. The microbial communities found in anaerobic digesters typically contain hydrogenotrophic methanogens, which can use hydrogen (H 2) as a reducing agent for conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2) into methane (CH 4). Thus, biological biogas upgrading through the exogenous addition of H 2 into biogas digesters for the conversion of CO 2 into CH 4 can increase CH 4 yield and lower CO 2 emission. Results: The addition of 4 mol of H 2 per mol of CO 2 was optimal for batch biogas reactors and increased the CH 4 content of the biogas from 67 to 94{\%}. The CO 2 content of the biogas was reduced from 33 to 3{\%} and the average residual H 2 content was 3{\%}. At molar H 2 :CO 2 ratios {\textgreater} 4:1, all CO 2 was converted into CH 4 , but the pH increased above 8 due to depletion of CO 2 , which negatively influenced the process stability. Additionally, high residual H 2 content in these reactors was unfavourable, causing volatile fatty acid accumulation and reduced CH 4 yields. The reactor microbial communities shifted in composition over time, which corresponded to changes in the reactor variables. Numerous taxa responded to the H 2 inputs, and in particular the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanobacterium increased in abundance with addition of H 2. In addition, the apparent rapid response of hydrogenotrophic methano-gens to intermittent H 2 feeding indicates the suitability of biological methanation for variable H 2 inputs, aligning well with fluctuations in renewable electricity production that may be used to produce H 2. Conclusions: Our research demonstrates that the H 2 :CO 2 ratio has a significant effect on reactor performance during in situ biological methanation. Consequently, the H 2 :CO 2 molar ratio should be kept at 4:1 to avoid process instability. A shift toward hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was indicated by an increase in the abundance of the obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanobacterium.},

Here we report the metagenome-guided isolation of a novel organism that represents a phylogenetically narrow ({\textgreater}97{\%} 16S rRNA gene identity) group of previously uncharacterized, crude-oil degraders. Analysis of available sequence data showed that these organisms are highly abundant in oiled sediments of coastal marine ecosystems across the world, often comprising {\~{}}30{\%} of the total community, and virtually absent in pristine sediments or seawater. The isolate genome encodes functional nitrogen fixation and hydrocarbon degradation genes together with putative genes for biosurfactant production that apparently facilitate growth in the typically nitrogen-limited, oiled environment.

abstract = {The dinitrogenase reductase gene (nifH) is the most widely established molecular marker for the study of nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes in nature. A large number of PCR primer sets have been developed for nifH amplification, and the effective deployment of these approaches should be guided by a rapid, easy-to-use analysis protocol. Bioinformatic analysis of marker gene sequences also requires considerable expertise. In this study, we advance the state of the art for nifH analysis by evaluating nifH primer set performance, developing an improved amplicon sequencing workflow, and implementing a user-friendly bioinformatics pipeline. The developed amplicon sequencing workflow is a three-stage PCR-based approach that uses established technologies for incorporating sample-specific barcode sequences and sequencing adapters. Based on our primer evaluation, we recommend the Ando primer set be used with a modified annealing temperature of 58°C, as this approach captured the largest diversity of nifH templates, including paralog cluster IV/V sequences. To improve nifH sequence analysis, we developed a computational pipeline which infers taxonomy and optionally filters out paralog sequences. In addition, we employed an empirical model to derive optimal operational taxonomic unit (OTU) cutoffs for the nifH gene at the species, genus, and family levels. A comprehensive workflow script named TaxADivA (TAXonomy Assignment and DIVersity Assessment) is provided to ease processing and analysis of nifH amplicons. Our approach is then validated through characterization of diazotroph communities across environmental gradients in beach sands impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, in a peat moss-dominated wetland, and in various plant compartments of a sugarcane field.IMPORTANCE Nitrogen availability often limits ecosystem productivity, and nitrogen fixation, exclusive to prokaryotes, comprises a major source of nitrogen input that sustains food webs. The nifH gene, which codes for the iron protein of the nitrogenase enzyme, is the most widely established molecular marker for the study of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) in nature. In this study, a flexible sequencing/analysis pipeline, named TaxADivA, was developed for nifH amplicons produced by Illumina paired-end sequencing, and it enables an inference of taxonomy, performs clustering, and produces output in formats that may be used by programs that facilitate data exploration and analysis. Diazotroph diversity and community composition are linked to ecosystem functioning, and our results advance the phylogenetic characterization of diazotroph communities by providing empirically derived nifH similarity cutoffs for species, genus, and family levels. The utility of our pipeline is validated for diazotroph communities in a variety of ecosystems, including contaminated beach sands, peatland ecosystems, living plant tissues, and rhizosphere soil.},

abstract = {Colorectal epithelial tumors occur spontaneously in dogs, and the pathogenesis seems to parallel that of humans. The development of human colorectal tumorigenesis has been linked to alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota. This study characterized the fecal- and mucosa-associated microbiota in dogs with colorectal epithelial tumors (n = 10). The fecal microbiota was characterized by 16S rDNA analysis and compared with that of control dogs (n = 13). We also determined the mucosa-associated microbiota composition in colonic tumor tissue (n = 8) and in adjacent non-tumor tissue (n = 5) by 16S rDNA- and rRNA profiling. The fecal microbial community structure in dogs with tumors was different from that of control samples and was distinguished by oligotypes affiliated with Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides, Helicobacter, Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus and Streptococcus, and lower abundance of Ruminococcaceae, Slackia, Clostridium XI and Faecalibacterium. The overall community structure and populations of mucosal bacteria were not different based on either the 16S rDNA or the 16S rRNA profile in tumor tissue vs. adjacent non-tumor tissue. However, the proportion of live, potentially active bacteria appeared to be higher in non-tumor tissue compared with tumor tissue and included Slackia, Roseburia, unclass. Ruminococcaeceae, unclass. Lachnospiraceae and Oscillibacter. Colorectal tumors are rarely diagnosed in dogs, but despite this limitation, we were able to show that dogs with colorectal tumors have distinct fecal microbiota profiles. These initial results support the need for future case-control studies that are adequately powered, as well as age-matched and breed-matched, in order to evaluate the influence of bacteria on colorectal cancer etiopathogenesis and to determine whether the bacteria may have potential as biomarkers in clinical settings.},

Hence, the effect of feeding frequency on process variables and microbial community structure was investigated by comparing a laboratory-scale digester fed steam exploded food waste 10 times daily vs. one fed an equivalent amount once daily. The Frequently Fed Digester (FFD) produced on average 20{\%} more methane and had lower effluent concentrations of long-chain fatty acids. Greater daily fluctuations in acetate, pH and biogas production rate could explain the lower specific methane yield and $\beta$-oxidation. Feeding frequency also influenced the microbial community whereby Tenericutes (42{\%}) dominated in FFD but Firmicutes (31{\%}) was most abundant in the Daily Fed Digester (DFD). Feeding frequency effects are therefore postulated to occur more often in digesters fed labile feedstocks at high organic loading rates.},

abstract = {Microbial communities were thoroughly characterized in a mesophilic anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) and a thermophilic continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), which were both treating recalcitrant microalgal biomass dominated by Scenedesmus. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analysis was performed when the AnMBR achieved 70{\%} algal biodegradation and revealed high microbial diversity, probably due to the high solid retention time (SRT) of the AnMBR configuration. The bacterial community consisted of Chloroflexi (27.9{\%}), WWE1 (19.0{\%}) and Proteobacteria (15.4{\%}) as the major phyla, followed by Spirochaetes (7.7{\%}), Bacteroidetes (5.9{\%}) and Firmicutes (3.6{\%}). These phyla are known to exhibit proteolytic and cellulolytic capabilities required to degrade the Scenedesmus cell-wall. Methanosaeta was the most abundant methanogen detected in the AnMBR suggesting that methane was mainly produced by the acetoclastic pathway. In comparison, the thermophilic CSTR achieved 32.6{\%} algal biodegradation, and its bacterial community had fewer Operational Taxonomic Units (977 OTUs) than the AnMBR (1396 OTUs), as is generally observed for high temperature biogas reactors. However, phyla with high hydrolytic potential were detected such as Firmicutes (34.6{\%}) and the candidate taxon EM3 (38.7{\%}) in the thermophilic CSTR. Although the functional metabolism of EM3 in anaerobic digesters is unknown, the high abundance of EM3 suggests that this taxon plays an important role in the thermophilic, anaerobic degradation of Scenedesmus. The abundant syntrophic bacteria and the detection of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the thermophilic CSTR suggest that the hydrogenotrophic pathway was the dominant pathway for methane production in this reactor.},

While degenerate PCR primers have been demonstrated to cause template-specific bias in PCR applications, the effect of such bias on qPCR has been less well explored. We used a set of diverse, full-length nifH gene standards to test the performance of several universal nifH primer sets in qPCR. We found significant template-specific bias in all but the PolF/ PolR primer set. Template-specific bias caused more than 1000-fold mis-estimation of nifH gene copy number for three of the primer sets and one primer set resulted in more than 10,000-fold mis-estimation. Furthermore, such template- specific bias will cause qPCR estimates to vary in response to beta-diversity, thereby causing mis-estimation of changes in gene copy number. A reduction in bias was achieved by in- creasing the primer concentration.We conclude that degener- ate primers should be evaluated across a range of templates, annealing temperatures, and primer concentrations to evaluate the potential for template-specific bias prior to their use in qPCR.},

abstract = {Microbial N 2 fixation (diazotrophy) represents an important nitrogen source to oligotrophic peatland ecosystems, which are important sinks for atmospheric CO 2 and are susceptible to the changing climate. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine the active microbial group and type of nitrogenase mediating diazotrophy in an ombrotrophic Sphagnum -dominated peat bog (the S1 peat bog, Marcell Experimental Forest, Minnesota, USA); and (ii) to determine the effect of environmental parameters (light, O 2 , CO 2 , and CH 4 ) on potential rates of diazotrophy measured by acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) reduction and 15 N 2 incorporation. A molecular analysis of metabolically active microbial communities suggested that diazotrophy in surface peat was primarily mediated by Alphaproteobacteria ( Bradyrhizobiaceae and Beijerinckiaceae ). Despite higher concentrations of dissolved vanadium ([V] 11 nM) than molybdenum ([Mo] 3 nM) in surface peat, a combination of metagenomic, amplicon sequencing, and activity measurements indicated that Mo-containing nitrogenases dominate over the V-containing form. Acetylene reduction was only detected in surface peat exposed to light, with the highest rates observed in peat collected from hollows with the highest water contents. Incorporation of 15 N 2 was suppressed 90{\%} by O 2 and 55{\%} by C 2 H 2 and was unaffected by CH 4 and CO 2 amendments. These results suggest that peatland diazotrophy is mediated by a combination of C 2 H 2 -sensitive and C 2 H 2 -insensitive microbes that are more active at low concentrations of O 2 and show similar activity at high and low concentrations of CH 4 .},

Diazotrophic microorganisms are taxonomically and metabolically diverse and they populate a wide variety of habitats. Diazotroph diversity is typically quantified through the analysis of nitrogenase nifH gene sequences recovered from environmental samples. In this chapter we review the global census of diazotrophic microorganisms as assessed by the diversity of nifH gene sequences in public sequence databases. We assess the diversity of diazotrophs found in different environments and taxonomic groupings and we also evaluate PCR primers and probes used to assess diazotroph diversity. Furthermore, we assess the range of habitats and geographic regions in which diazotrophic diversity has been assessed. We find that diazotrophs in many habitats remain under sampled. We also find that nifH cluster III, which includes obligate anaerobes, contains the greatest diversity of nifH sequences and that anoxic environments both contain the greatest diversity of diazotrophs and are the environments in which diazotrophic diversity is most poorly sampled. Our knowledge of diazotroph diversity is likely to expand dramatically as next-generation sequencing technologies are targeted towards surveys of the nifH gene.},

abstract = {We describe a nitrogenase gene sequence database that facilitates analysis of the evolution and ecology of nitrogen-fixing organisms. The database contains 32 954 aligned nitrogenase nifH sequences linked to phylogenetic trees and associated sequence metadata. The database includes 185 linked multigene entries including full-length nifH, nifD, nifK and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences. Evolutionary analyses enabled by the multigene entries support an ancient horizontal transfer of nitrogenase genes between Archaea and Bacteria and provide evidence that nifH has a different history of horizontal gene transfer from the nifDK enzyme core. Further analyses show that lineages in nitrogenase cluster I and cluster III have different rates of substitution within nifD, suggesting that nifD is under different selection pressure in these two lineages. Finally, we find that that the genetic divergence of nifH and 16S rRNA genes does not correlate well at sequence dissimilarity values used commonly to define microbial species, as stains having {\textless}3{\%} sequence dissimilarity in their 16S rRNA genes can have up to 23{\%} dissimilarity in nifH. The nifH database has a number of uses including phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses, the design and assessment of primers/probes and the evaluation of nitrogenase sequence diversity.

abstract = {The nifH gene is the most widely sequenced marker gene used to identify nitrogen-fixing Bacteria and Archaea. Numerous PCR primers have been designed to amplify nifH, but a comprehensive evaluation of nifH PCR primers has not been performed. We performed an in silico analysis of the specificity and coverage of 51 universal and 35 group-specific nifH primers by using an aligned database of 23,847 nifH sequences. We found that there are 15 universal nifH primers that target 90{\%} or more of nitrogen fixers, but that there are also 23 nifH primers that target less than 50{\%} of nifH sequences. The nifH primers we evaluated vary in their phylogenetic bias and their ability to recover sequences from commonly sampled environments. In addition, many of these primers will amplify genes that do not mediate nitrogen fixation, and thus it would be advisable for researchers to screen their sequencing results for the presence of non-target genes before analysis. Universal primers that performed well in silico were tested empirically with soil samples and with genomic DNA from a phylogenetically diverse set of nitrogen-fixing strains. This analysis will be of great utility to those engaged in molecular analysis of nifH genes from isolates and environmental samples.},

abstract = {The global diversity of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms was assessed through construction and analysis of an aligned database of 16,989 nifH sequences. We conclude that the diversity of diazotrophs is still poorly described and that many organisms remain to be discovered. Our analyses indicate that diversity is not distributed evenly across phylogenetic groups or across environments and that some of the most diverse assemblages and environments remain the most poorly characterized. The majority of OTUs were rare, falling in the long tail of the frequency distribution. The most dominant OTUs fell into either the Cyanobacteria or the $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ Proteobacteria, and five of these dominant OTUs do not have any representatives cultivated in isolation. Soils contained the greatest diversity of nifH sequences of all of the environments surveyed. Cluster III, which is dominated by nifH sequences from obligate anaerobes, was found to contain the greatest diversity of all nifH lineages and is also the group for which diversity is the least sampled. Our findings provide context for ongoing efforts to explore diazotroph diversity, indicating specific groups and environments that remain poorly characterized.},
